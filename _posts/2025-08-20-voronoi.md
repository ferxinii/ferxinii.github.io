# Voronoi and Delaunay cells

From now on, consider $$S$$ to be a finite set of $$m$$ distinct points
in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$. We denote as
$$d(\cdot, \cdot) \colon \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
the euclidean metric.

Many definitions and results used throughout this chapter are found and
proved in appendix
[\[chapter:app_convex_geometry\]](#chapter:app_convex_geometry). We just
require the introduction of the following object.

<div class="definition">
**(Hypersphere)** Given a centre $$c \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ and a radius
$$r > 0$$, the corresponding hypersphere is
$$\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid d(x,c) = r\}$$.

</div>

## Voronoi diagrams

<div class="definition">
Let $$R \subset S$$. The *Voronoi cell of $$R$$*, $$V(R)$$, is the set
of all points of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ equidistant from all sites in $$R$$
and closer to every site in $$R$$ than to any site not in $$R$$. That
is,  
$$V(R) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid d(x,r_1) = d(x, r_2), \ d(x, r_3) < d(x, q) \ \forall r_1, r_2, r_3 \in R, \ q \in S \setminus R\}$$.

</div>
<div class="example">
Consider 2 distinct points $$p_1, p_2 \in \mathbb{R}^n$$. Then,
$$V(\{p_1, p_2\})$$ is the hyperplane perpendicular to the segment
joining both points and equidistant to them. $$V(\{p_1\}), V(\{p_2\})$$
are the corresponding half-spaces.

</div>
<div class="example">
Consider 3 distinct points in the plane
$$p_1, p_2, p_3 \in \mathbb{R}^2$$. $$V(\{p_1, p_2, p_3\})$$ is the
single point equidistant to the three of them—the centre of their
circumcircle. For $$i \neq j, \ V(\{p_i, p_j\})$$ is the semi-infinite
line starting at $$V(\{p_1, p_2, p_3\})$$ and perpendicular to the
segment joining $$p_i, p_j$$. $$V(\{p_i\})$$ is the corresponding
translated cone bounded by these semi-infinite lines.

</div>
<div class="example">
Consider 4 distinct points in the plane. Then,
$$V(\{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\})$$ is empty unless all 4 points lie on the
same circle, in which case it is the centre.

</div>
<div class="proposition">
For $$R \subset S$$, $$V(R)$$ is the relative interior of a polyhedron.

</div>
<details markdown="1"><summary markdown="span">*Proof*</summary>
<div class="proof">
By [\[def:polyhedral\]](#def:polyhedral), we have to show that $$V(R)$$
can be written as the relative interior of the intersection of a finite
collection of closed half-spaces. In particular,
$$d(x, r) < d(x, q) \iff \langle x-r, x-r \rangle < \langle x-q, x-q \rangle \iff - 2 \langle x, r \rangle + \lvert \lvert  r\lvert \lvert ^2 < - 2 \langle x, q \rangle + \lvert \lvert  q\lvert \lvert ^2 \iff \langle x, b \rangle < \beta$$,
with
$$b = q -r, \ \beta = \frac{\lvert \lvert q\lvert \lvert ^2 - \lvert \lvert r\lvert \lvert ^2}{2}$$.
Therefore, $$x$$ must lie in an open half-space of the hyperplane
$$H = \{ x \mid \langle x, b \rangle = \beta \}$$. We find all necessary
hyperplanes by running over all $$r \in R, \ q \in S \setminus R$$. For
the equality of distance condition, we can express it as the
intersection of two closed halfspaces. Finally, note that $$S$$ is
finite, and the fact that the inequalities are strict corresponds to
taking the relative interior. ◻
</div></details>


As a consequence, all Voronoi cells must be convex.

<div class="proposition">
<span id="prop:unbounded_voronoi" label="prop:unbounded_voronoi"></span>
For a site $$r \in S$$, $$V(\{ r \})$$ is unbounded $$\iff$$
$$r \in \partial \mathrm{conv}(S)$$, that is, $$r$$ lies on the boundary
of the convex hull of $$S$$.

</div>
<details markdown="1"><summary markdown="span">*Proof*</summary>
<div class="proof">
($$\Rightarrow$$ by contrapositive) Suppose
$$r \in \mathrm{int}(\mathrm{conv}(S))$$. Let $$v$$ be an arbitrary unit
vector, and construct the ray $$s(t) = r + tv, \ t \geq 0$$. Define the
*sweeping* hyperplane $$\perp$$ to $$v$$ containing $$s(t)$$:
$$H_t = \{ x \mid \langle x - s(t), v \rangle = 0 \} = \{ x \mid \langle x - r, v \rangle = t \}$$.
Since $$S$$ is compact and $$r\in \mathrm{int}(\mathrm{conv}(S))$$, then
$$\exists \max_{q \in S \setminus \{r\}} \langle q - r , v\rangle$$.
Call this value $$t_M$$, so for $$t > t_M$$, $$H_t$$ will never pass
through any other site. Let $$q_M \in S \setminus \{r\}$$ achieve such a
maximum. Then,
$$\lvert \lvert s(t) - q_M\lvert \lvert ^2 = t^2 + \lvert \lvert r-q_M\lvert \lvert ^2 - 2 t t_M \Rightarrow d(s(t), q_M)^2 - d(s(t), r)^2 = d(r,q_M)^2 - 2 t t_M$$.
Therefore, if
$$t > \max(t_M, \frac{d(p, q_M)}{2 t_M}) \Rightarrow d(s(t), q_M) < d(s(t), r) \Rightarrow s(t) \not \in V(\{ r\}) \Rightarrow V(\{r\})$$
is bounded. We conclude that if $$V(\{r\})$$ is unbounded,
$$r \not \in \mathrm{int}(\mathrm{conv}(S)) \Rightarrow r \in \partial \mathrm{conv(S)}$$.

($$\Leftarrow$$) Assume $$r \in \partial \mathrm{conv}(S)$$ with
$$V(\{ r \}) \neq \emptyset$$. Then, by
[\[thm:support_hyp\]](#thm:support_hyp) $$\exists$$ a supporting
hyperplane touching $$\mathrm{conv}(S)$$ only at $$r$$ such that
$$\mathrm{conv}(S)$$ lies entirely in one of the corresponding
half-spaces. Take its normal outward direction $$v$$, and define the ray
$$s(t) = r + t v, \ t \geq 0$$. Then,
$$d(r, s(t)) < d(q, s(t)) \ \forall t \geq 0, q \in S \setminus \{ r\}$$.
Thus, $$s(t) \in V(\{ r \}) \ \forall t \geq 0$$, and since $$s(t)$$ is
unbounded, $$V(\{ r \})$$ must also be unbounded. ◻
</div></details>


Then, since bounded voronoi cells are bounded polyhedra, they must also
be polytopes (see [\[sec:polyh\]](#sec:polyh)), so they have a finite
representation in the sense of [\[def:polytope\]](#def:polytope). That
is, bounded voronoi cells are the convex hull of a finite number of
vertices.

<div class="definition">
The *Voronoi diagram* of $$S$$, $$V_S$$, is the collection of all
non-empty Voronoi cells $$V(R)$$ for $$R \subset S$$.

</div>
<div class="theorem">
<span id="thm:vor_complex" label="thm:vor_complex"></span> $$V_S$$ is a
cell complex (in the sense of [\[def:cell_complex\]](#def:cell_complex))
that partitions $$\mathbb{R}^n$$.

</div>
<details markdown="1"><summary markdown="span">*Proof*</summary>
<div class="proof">
We first show that the Voronoi cells are pairwise disjoint. Let
$$R, R' \subset S, R \neq R'$$. Assume
$$V(R) \cap V(R') \neq \emptyset$$. Take $$x \in V(R) \cap V(R')$$.
Since $$x \in V(R)$$,
$$d(x, r) < d(x, r')\ \forall r \in R, r' \in R'$$. However, we must
also have $$d(x, r') < d(x, r)\ \forall r' \in R', r \in R$$, which is a
contradiction. Therefore, $$V(R) \cap V(R') = \emptyset$$ and the
Voronoi cells are all pairwise disjoint.  
We now wish to show that every face of every cell of $$V_S$$ is also in
$$V_S$$. Take $$V(R)$$ for some $$R \subset S$$. Any face of $$V(R)$$
corresponds to the set obtained by *tightening* some of the inequalities
$$d(x,r) < d(x,q) \rightarrow d(x,r) = d(x,q)$$ $$\forall r \in R$$ for
some $$q \in S \setminus R$$. Therefore, such a face corresponds to
$$V(R \cup q)$$ for some
$$q = \{q_1, \ldots, q_k\} \subset S \setminus R$$, so it must also
belong to $$V_S$$.  
To see that it partitions $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, we show that
$$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n$$, $$x \in V(R)$$ for some $$R \subset S$$.
It suffices to find the site $$r \in R$$ that is closest to $$x$$, and
by definition $$x \in V(\{r\})$$. If $$x$$ is equidistant to more than
one site, gather them in a set $$\{r_1, \ldots, r_k\}$$ and then again
$$x \in V(\{ r_1, \ldots, r_k\})$$. ◻
</div></details>


Therefore, any point $$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ lies in $$V(R)$$ for some
$$R \subset S$$, although $$R$$ may consist of more than a single point.
However, for an arbitrary $$R \subset S$$, $$V(R)$$ may be empty. This
happens if any of the conditions of the definition cannot be satisfied.

## Delaunay triangulations

<div class="definition">
If $$R \subset S$$ and $$V(R) \neq \emptyset$$, the *Delaunay cell*
$$D(R)$$ is defined as $$\mathrm{cell}(R)$$. That is,
$$D(R) = \mathrm{cell}(R) = \mathrm{ri}(\mathrm{conv}(R))$$ (see
[\[def:cell\]](#def:cell)).

</div>

Note that by definition, a Delaunay cell is convex. The next is a very
important property characterising such cells.

<div class="lemma">
<span id="lemma:circum_sph" label="lemma:circum_sph"></span>**(Empty
sphere property)** For $$R \subset S$$, $$D(R)$$ is a Delaunay cell
$$\iff$$ $$\exists$$ a circumscribed hypersphere of $$R$$ that contains
no site of $$S \setminus R$$ in its interior.

</div>
<details markdown="1"><summary markdown="span">*Proof*</summary>
<div class="proof">
$$(\Rightarrow)$$ Assume $$D(R)$$ is a Delaunay cell, so
$$V(R) \neq \emptyset$$. Take $$x \in V(R)$$. Then
$$d(x, r_i) = d(x, r_j) \ \forall r_i, r_j \in R$$. Construct the
hypersphere centred at $$x$$ with radius $$d(x, r_i)$$. This is a
circumscribed hypersphere of $$R$$, since all sites of $$R$$ belong to
it. By the second property of $$V(R)$$,
$$d(x, r_k) < d(x, r_l), \forall r_k \in R, r_l \in S \setminus R$$, so
all sites of $$S \setminus R$$ lie in its exterior.

$$(\Leftarrow)$$ Conversely, assume $$\exists$$ such a hypersphere of
$$R$$. By definition, its center belongs to
$$V(R) \Rightarrow V(R) \neq \emptyset$$, so $$D(R)$$ is well defined. ◻
</div></details>


It is important to note that a Delaunay cell is not necessarily a
simplex. This can happen in degenerate cases as we discuss in the last
section. Therefore, $$D_S$$ need not be a *proper* triangulation (in the
sense of [\[def:proper_triang\]](#def:proper_triang)).

<div class="example">
Consider 4 cocircular points in the plane. Then,
$$V(\{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \})$$ is the center of the circle, and
$$D(\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\})$$ is a quadrilateral (which is not a
simplex).

</div>
<div class="definition">
The *Delaunay triangulation* of $$S$$, $$D_S$$, is the collection of
Delaunay cells $$D(R)$$ for $$R \subset S$$ and $$V(R) \neq \emptyset$$.

</div>
<div class="theorem">
<span id="thm:del_triang" label="thm:del_triang"></span> $$D_S$$ is a
triangulation of $$S$$ (in the sense of
[\[def:triangulation\]](#def:triangulation)).

</div>
<details markdown="1"><summary markdown="span">*Proof*</summary>
<div class="proof">
 

1.  We first prove that Delaunay cells are pairwise disjoint. Consider
    $$R, R' \subset S, \ R \neq R'$$, having well defined Delaunay
    cells. If $$R' \subset R$$, then $$\mathrm{conv}(R')$$ is a face of
    $$\mathrm{conv}(R)$$, and their relative interiors must be disjoint
    by [\[cor:face_ri\]](#cor:face_ri). If $$R \cap R' \neq \emptyset$$
    but $$R' \not\subset R$$ and $$R \not \subset R'$$, we can construct
    a hyperplane intersecting $$R \cap R'$$ separating (non-strictly)
    $$D(R)$$ and $$D(R')$$
    ([\[thm:hyperplane_sep\]](#thm:hyperplane_sep)). Finally, if
    $$R \cap R' = \emptyset$$, consider the corresponding circumscribed
    hyperspheres $$C, C'$$ satisfying the empty sphere property, and we
    have two cases. If
    $$C \cap C' = \emptyset \Rightarrow D(R) \cap D(R') = \emptyset$$.
    Otherwise, construct a hyperplane passing through $$C \cap C'$$
    strictly separating $$R$$ and $$R'$$.

2.  We now show that every face of a Delaunay cell $$D(R)$$ is also a
    Delaunay cell. Any face of $$D(R)$$, different from $$D(R)$$ itself,
    is precisely $$\mathrm{cell}(R')$$ with $$R' = R \cap H$$ for some
    hyperplane $$H$$ supporting $$\mathrm{conv}(R)$$. An empty
    circumscribed sphere to $$R$$ can be slightly perturbed to be an
    empty circumscribed sphere of $$R'$$, so $$\mathrm{cell}(R')$$ is
    also a Delaunay cell by [\[lemma:circum_sph\]](#lemma:circum_sph).

3.  Thus far we have proved that $$D_S$$ is a cell complex. We now show
    that $$\mathrm{conv}(S) = \bigcup_{R \subset S} D(R)$$. Consider
    $$x \in \mathrm{conv}(S)$$. By Carathéodory’s theorem
    [\[thm:caratheodory\]](#thm:caratheodory), $$\exists R \subset S$$
    such that $$x \in \mathrm{conv}(R)$$ with
    $$\lvert R\lvert  \leq n+1$$. Take $$R$$ as the minimal such set,
    that is, the one with the least elements s.t.
    $$x \in \mathrm{ri}(\mathrm{conv}(R))$$. (*a*) If
    $$\lvert R\lvert  = n+1$$, then $$\exists ! C$$ circumscribed
    hypersphere to $$R$$. If $$\exists q \in S \setminus R$$ that lies
    inside $$C$$, we can replace a point of $$R$$ by $$q$$, such that
    $$x$$ is still in its convex hull but the hypersphere is smaller.
    Repeat until there is no such point inside $$C$$, so by
    [\[lemma:circum_sph\]](#lemma:circum_sph), $$x \in D(R)$$. (*b*) If
    $$\lvert R\lvert  < n+1$$, a similar construction is done on
    $$\mathrm{aff}(R)$$, resulting in a Delaunay cell of smaller
    dimension. Therefore,
    $$\mathrm{conv}(S) \subset \bigcup_{R \subset S} D(R)$$. Note that
    $$\bigcup_{R \subset S} D(R) \subset \mathrm{conv}(S)$$ is true by
    definition.

4.  As shown, every face of every cell must belong to $$D_S$$, in
    particular 0-dimensional faces which correspond to the vertices in
    $$S$$. Conversely, assume that there exists a point $$p \in S$$ that
    is not a vertex in $$D_S$$. Thus, it must lie strictly inside some
    $$D(R)\subset D_S$$, violating the empty sphere condition and
    resulting in a contradiction. Therefore, the vertices of $$D_S$$ are
    precisely $$S$$.

</div></details>


Finally, it is useful to characterise Delaunay cells locally.

<div class="definition">
Two opposite $$n$$-cells $$\mathrm{cell}(R)$$ and $$\mathrm{cell}(R')$$
are *locally Delaunay* if $$R, R'$$ have corresponding circumscribed
hyperspheres $$C, C'$$ such that $$R \setminus R'$$ lies outside $$C'$$
(equivalently, $$R' \setminus R$$ lies outside $$C$$).

</div>
<div class="lemma">
A triangulation is Delaunay $$\iff$$ all $$n$$-cells are locally
Delaunay.

</div>
<details markdown="1"><summary markdown="span">*Proof*</summary>
<div class="proof">
($$\Rightarrow$$) If a triangulation is Delaunay, then by the empty
sphere property, all $$n$$-cells must be locally Delaunay.
($$\Leftarrow$$) Select an $$n$$-cell $$D(R)$$. We will prove that any
$$s \in S \setminus R$$ lies outside of the circumscribed hypersphere of
$$R$$. Select $$r \in \mathrm{int}(\mathrm{conv}(R)) = D(R)$$ such that
the line segment $$\overline{rs}$$ avoids all $$k$$-cells for
$$k \leq n-2$$ and intersects $$(n-1)$$-cells transversally. We may
always find such an $$r$$ since the triangulation is finite and the set
of "bad" directions is a finite union of lower-dimensional subsets of
the unit sphere of measure zero. This generates a sequence
$$N_0, F_1, N_1, \ldots, F_k, N_k$$ where $$N_i$$ are the $$n$$-cells
and $$F_i$$ the $$(n-1)$$-cells (facets) that $$\overline{rs}$$
intersects until it arrives to $$s$$. Denote by $$C_i$$ the
circumscribed hypersphere of $$N_i$$. We will do an inverse induction on
$$i = k, \ldots, 0$$. For the base case consider $$N_k$$, note that
there is a hyperplane passing through $$F_k$$ separating $$s$$ from
$$N_{k-1}$$ and $$s$$ must lie outside of $$C_{k-1}$$ (locally
Delaunay). The induction hypothesis is that $$s$$ lies outside of
$$C_i$$. Now, consider $$N_{i-1}$$. The hyperplane passing through
$$F_i$$ separates the only vertex of $$N_i$$ not shared by $$N_{i-1}$$,
and it must lie outside of $$C_{i-1}$$ (locally Delaunay). Since the
intersection of $$\overline{rs}$$ with $$F_{i}$$ is transversal, $$s$$
must also lie on the same side of the plane, and by the induction
hypothesis, it must also be outside of $$C_{i-1}$$. Thus, we have proved
that $$s \not \in C_0$$, so all sites $$s \in S \setminus R$$ are
outside the circumscribed hypersphere of $$R$$. ◻
</div></details>


## Duality {#sec:duality}

The following theorem establishes a duality relationship between $$V_S$$
and $$D_S$$.

<div class="theorem">
$$V_S$$ and $$D_S$$ are dual. That is, for $$R, R' \subset S$$, $$V(R)$$
is a face of $$V(R')$$ $$\iff$$ $$D(R')$$ is a face of $$D(R)$$.

</div>

The proof makes use of many constructions developed in the proofs of
[\[thm:vor_complex\]](#thm:vor_complex) and
[\[thm:del_triang\]](#thm:del_triang)

<details markdown="1"><summary markdown="span">*Proof*</summary>
<div class="proof">
Suppose $$V(R), V(R')$$ are distinct Voronoi cells, so $$D(R), D(R')$$
are distinct Delaunay cells. Then, $$V(R')$$ is a face of $$V(R)$$
$$\iff$$ some of the inequalities defining $$V(R)$$ are tightened to
equalities $$\iff R' = R \cup q$$ for some $$q \subset S \setminus R$$
$$\iff R = R' \cap H$$ for some hyperplane $$H$$ containing $$q$$ that
supports the convex hull of $$R'$$ $$\iff D(R)$$ is a face of
$$D(R')$$. ◻

## Dimensionality and degeneracies

<div class="proposition">
<span id="prop:dim_voronoi" label="prop:dim_voronoi"></span> If
$$V(R) \neq \emptyset$$,

<details markdown="1"><summary markdown="span">*Proof*</summary>
<div class="proof">
Note $$V(R)$$ is a relatively open subset of the affine set
$$M = \{ x \mid d(x, r_i) = d(x, r_j) \ \forall r_i, r_j \in R\}$$, so
$$dim(V(R)) = dim(M)$$. Note
$$d(x, r_i) = d(x, r_j) \ \forall r_i, r_j \in R \iff \langle x, r_i - r_1 \rangle = \frac{1}{2}( \lvert \lvert r_i\lvert \lvert ^2 - \lvert \lvert r_1\lvert \lvert ^2) \ \forall r_i \neq r_1 \in R$$,
so $$x$$ is the solution set to the system $$\mathbf{A} x = b$$, with
$$\mathbf{A}$$ having $$r_i - r_1$$ as columns. Then,
$$\mathrm{dim}(M) = n - \mathrm{rank}(\mathbf{A})$$. Note that by
definition ([\[def:conv_dim\]](#def:conv_dim))
$$\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{conv}(R)) = \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{aff}(R))$$, and
as developed in [\[sec:affine\]](#sec:affine),

If the cells are degenerate, the previous propositions imply that the
sites in $$R$$ are not affinely independent. That is, all sites lie on a

Furthermore, since $$D(R)$$ is well defined, all sites must lie on a
common circumscribed hypersphere; otherwise the empty sphere condition
would not be satisfied. Thus, if $$\lvert R\lvert  > n +1$$ and
$$V(R) \neq \emptyset$$, the sites must lie on a common circumscribed
hypersphere, and the corresponding cells are degenerate.

$$\lvert R\lvert  = 2$$, $$R = \{ r_1, r_2\}$$. If
$$V(R) \neq \emptyset$$, $$V(R)$$ must be a relatively open subset of
the 1-dimensional affine space $$d(x, r_1) = d(x, r_2)$$, so
$$\mathrm{dim}(V(R)) \leq 1$$. In fact,
$$\mathrm{dim}(V(R)) \leq \min \{n-1, 1\}$$ (if $$n=1$$, then
$$V(\{r_1, r_2\})$$ must be a single point), so
$$\mathrm{dim}(V(R)) \not > n - 1$$. For $$\lvert R\lvert  = 3$$, note
that the sites cannot lie in a line and in a hypersphere simultenously,
so degeneracy is not possible. ◻

$$S$$ is in *general position* if no $$n+2$$ points lie on a common

If $$S$$ is in general position, then no cell is degenerate. In such a
case, all Delaunay cells are simplexes, so $$D_S$$ is a *proper*
triangulation. Additionally, all Voronoi cells have dimension
$$n-(\lvert R\lvert -1)$$ and all Delaunay cells have dimension
$$\lvert R\lvert -1$$.
